# Deep_learning_books
Hi everyone !!!
\n I have created this repository in order to put some of the machine/ deep learning interesting books. You will find mathematical explanation of machine learning and how to implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch.
You will also go deep into neural networks tchniques and algorithms.
This repository is for people who are into reading, for the others I recommand online courses on Coursera or Udemy which will help you developp your skills in Machine and deep learning by doing.
